# SAE Vision - Bottle Cap Localization

This project is part of the work completed during the third year of the BUT program in SAE Vision.  
Its goal is to locate bottle caps in images using two different methods:

- **Method 1**: Detection by pattern and mask  
- **Method 2**: Detection by concentric circles  
- **Method 3**: Detection by concentric ellipses
